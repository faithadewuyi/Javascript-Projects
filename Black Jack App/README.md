# Blackjack Game

This Blackjack game is a simple, interactive web application designed to help beginners learn and practice JavaScript fundamentals. It utilizes HTML and CSS for structure and styling, while the game logic is entirely implemented using JavaScript. This project serves as a practical showcase of understanding arrays, objects, booleans, conditional statements (if-else), logical operators, comparison operators, loops (for loop), the Math object, and the return statement in JavaScript.



## General Info

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive Blackjack game that can be played in the browser. It's designed for those who are new to programming and are looking to apply their knowledge in a fun and engaging way. Throughout the development of this game, fundamental programming concepts were applied to create a functional and enjoyable user experience.

## Technologies

This project was created with:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript ES6

## Features


Programming concepts used in this project:
- **Arrays** to hold the deck of cards and player/dealer hands.
- **Objects** to represent each card with a value and suit.
- **Booleans** to determine game states (e.g., game over, player turn).
- **Conditional Statements (if-else)** to implement game rules.
- **Logical Operators** to check multiple conditions for game decisions.
- **Comparison Operators** to compare card values and scores.
- **Loops (for loop)** to iterate through arrays (e.g., shuffling the deck, dealing cards).
- **Math Object** to randomly shuffle the deck of cards.
- **Return Statement** to return values from functions, facilitating game logic and flow.
