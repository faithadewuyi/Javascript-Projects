# Cookie Consent Satire

A playful and satirical take on the cookie consent banners and data privacy dialogs that have become ubiquitous on the web. 

## Description

This project presents a fictional scenario where users are prompted to give consent for their data to be used. Upon agreeing, the website pretends to upload the user's data to the dark web, eventually thanking them for selling their soul. It's a humorous way to critique and bring attention to the sometimes invasive and misleading nature of online consent forms.

## Features

- A modal popup that displays upon visiting the site, asking for consent.
- Dynamic content changes within the modal based on user interaction.
- A "Decline" button that playfully moves away from the cursor, avoiding being clicked.
- A simulated process of "uploading data to the dark web" after the user consents.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the web page and modal.
- **CSS3**: Styling of the webpage and modal, including responsive and interactive elements.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Handling user interactions, form submission, and dynamic content updates.

## JavaScript Concepts Demonstrated

- **DOM Manipulation**: Accessing and modifying HTML elements.
- **Event Handling**: Listening for and responding to user events like clicks and form submissions.

- **Template Literals**: Dynamically embedding variables within HTML strings.
- **setTimeout**: Delaying execution of code to simulate asynchronous operations.

## Getting Started
