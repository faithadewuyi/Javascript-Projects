# Interactive Scoreboard Project

The Interactive Scoreboard is a web-based application designed to keep track of scores for two teams, Home and Guest. It features a simple, user-friendly interface that allows users to add points to each team's score with the click of a button. This project was created to demonstrate the use of basic JavaScript functions, the `onclick` property, and dynamic HTML content manipulation.

## Features

- **Simple UI**: The scoreboard has a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy to use for anyone.
- **Score Adjustment**: Users can increase the score for either team by 1, 2, or 3 points using dedicated buttons.
- **Leader Highlight**: The scoreboard dynamically highlights the leading team to easily identify who is ahead.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Implement JavaScript functions to handle user interactions.
- Manipulate the DOM to update the webpage content in real-time.
- Use CSS for basic styling and to highlight the leading team dynamically.
- Apply the `onclick` property in HTML elements to handle click events.
